## Experience

#### GIS Freelancing | 11.2023 - Present
- Offering services around the conceptualization and implementation of geospatial mental models, infrastructure, data modeling, and processing.
- Example project (100 hours): For a Swiss startup, conceptualized and implemented infrastructure to periodically source various publicly available datasets, such as GWR and AV. Applied advanced processing and made the resulting datasets available through an API in a fully automated, cost-effective manner using open source components and cloud-native data formats.

#### Sabbatical | 06.2023 - Present
- Explored various potential future paths in the education sector, ultimately deciding to continue my current pursuits.
- Deepened knowledge in GIS and AI, applying them in several personal projects.
- Achieved personal growth goals, including learning to swim, traveling, and engaging with the global community of serious game researchers.

#### Geospatial Data Engineer | MSCI | 05.2019 - 05.2023
- Joined early-stage startup CarbonDelta, contributing to its acquisition and integration into MSCI and aiding in shaping processes and products.
- As the technical lead for MSCI's asset location database, I collaborated closely with a dedicated team to provide high-quality fundamental geospatial data for various products. This [presentation at Google Next 2024](https://youtu.be/olGHj3j_hsY?si=5YkPNT95OMSWysdm) builds on this work. *Technologies: Python Django, PostGIS, GDAL, OGR, Azure Cloud, DevOps, Kubernetes, Leaflet, Databricks, Apache Sedona.*
- Initiated and led the introduction of interactive maps on MSCI's client-facing platforms. [Product PDF](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWOfc8). *Technologies: QGIS, QGIS server, Azure Cloud, DevOps, Docker, Kubernetes, PowerBI, Mapproxy, Mapbox GL JS.*
- As technical lead of MSCI's first biodiversity product line, I drove technical discussions with amazing client-facing, research and technology colleagues, which allowed us to transform an idea to market product within weeks instead of months. [Product PDF](https://www.msci.com/documents/1296102/35426413/MSCI%2BBiodiversity-crb-en.pdf). *Technologies: Large scale raster analysis, GDAL, Python Rasterio, Django, Jupyter notebooks,.*
- Managed up to five junior engineers and supervised the education of an ICT apprentice.

#### Research Assistant | ETH | 09.2016 - 04.2019
- Served as a teaching assistant for the advanced GIS course "Spatial Analysis, Modeling and Optimization (SAMO)", enabling students to solve complex real-world problems using ArcGIS, QGIS, and Matlab.
- Assisted various PhD candidates with geospatial processing and Python.
