## Experience

#### GIS freelancing | 11.2023 - today
- I offer services around conceptualization and implementation of geospatial mental models infrastructure, data modeling, and processing.
- Example project (100 hours): For a Swiss Startup I conceptualized and implemented the infrastructure to periodically source various publicly available datasets, such as GWR and AV, apply non-trivial processing and make the resulting datasets available through an api in a fully automated way. Due to cost constraints and low frequency processing cycles, a fully elastic cloud solution with a focus on open source components and cloud native data formats was conceived and successfully implemented.

#### Sabbatical | 06.2023 - today
- Following my passion for education, I explored various potential future paths in the education sector. I decided to not further pursue this at the moment.
- I enjoyed the luxury to deep dive into various GIS and AI related topics and apply them in a range of personal projects. 
- Pursued personal growth goals, including learning how to swim, travelling, and getting to know the global community of serious game research.

#### Geospatial data engineer | MSCI | 05.2019 - 05.2023
- As an early employee of startup CarbonDelta, I was part of the whole acquisition and integration process into MSCI and helped shaping processes and products.
- As the technical lead of MSCI's asset location database, I worked closely with a great team to provide high quality fundamental geospatial data for various products. Technologies included Django, PostGIS, GDAL, Azure Devops, Kubernetes, Leaflet.
- I drove the initiative to bring interactive maps to MSCI's client facing platforms for the first time. [Announcement pdf](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWOfc8). Technologies included QGIS, QGIS server, Azure Devops, Kubernetes, PowerBI, Mapproxy, Mapbox GL JS.
- As a people manager I guided up to 5 junior engineers and was responsible for the successful education of an ICT apprentice.

#### Research assistant | ETH | 09.2016 - 04.2019
- As a teaching assistant of the advanced GIS course Spatial Analysis, Modeling and Optimization (SAMO), I enabled students to solve complex real world problems using ArcGIS, QGIS and Matlab.
- I supported various PhD candidates on the topics of geospatial processing and Python.

## Education
#### CAS GIS | ETH | 09.2021 - 06.2022
- Acquired a broad foundation of GIS concepts and applications.
